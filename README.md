# facebook_group_crawler_private
simple facebook group crawler for even private group


Now, facebook GraphAPI policy for private group crawling is allowed for just only for group granted API.
We can crawl that undirectly with facebook's mobile version url or mbasic url. ex) https://mbasic.facebook.com



you can find mbasic url easily (if hard, first start searching with m.facebook.com and replace m to mbasic in urls)
Auto transforming url is easy so will be updated soon!
